This package uses the simple-patchsys of cdbs.

The following patches are used:
0001:	Fixes the header inclusion in the Makefiles.
	This for example make distcheck
0002:	Includes all generated libraries as linktargets in the pkg-config file.
	Reason: Currently libnl2 generates a bunch of child libraries.
	These don't get individual .pc files from upstream at the moment but
	programs linking against libnl2 using the .pc file mostly need these
	additional libraries too.
